# Stock Trading System

A common problem that I've observed in the trading world is that a huge number of traders make use of different trading accounts based on the brokerage fee. A trader needs to check the status of different trading accounts by logging on to their respective databases. Their current situation doesn't allow them to generate insights or get a wholistic view of their portfolio.
I solve this hassle of managing different databases by designing a single database that consolidates all the trading accounts of a particular user on a unified platform. This single place for all the databases helps to generate views, triggers and reports in the form of key statistics & visualizations for each trader. Thereby giving him a fare idea to decide what his next move should be in the world of investing by analyzing his overall portfolio value.
